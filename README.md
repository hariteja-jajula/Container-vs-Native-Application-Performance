# Container-vs-Native-Application-Performance


**Container vs Native Application Performance Comparison**

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and comparison of application performance in containerized (Singularity) and native environments. The project benchmarks various HPC applications using metrics such as execution time, latency, memory usage, and communication overhead. The focus is on identifying the performance impact of containerization across different applications, with a detailed breakdown of results from tests like MiniVite, OSU micro-benchmarks, and GAN training.

Key features:
- Detailed comparison of application performance in both container and native environments
- OSU micro-benchmarks results for MPI communication patterns
- Analysis of execution overhead, memory usage, and network latency
- Documentation on the setup and running of containerized applications
- Scripts and logs for reproducibility of tests and results
